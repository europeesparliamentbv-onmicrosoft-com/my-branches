<p>Signing for iOS apps may start failing from 2 September 2020 due to code-signing requiring the new, updated WWDR Intermediate Certificate. Many of the Xcode images that CircleCI provides were created before the new certificate was issued and as such require the certificate to be installed during the job. More information about the WWDR Intermediate Certificate expiration can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/expiration/" target="_self">on Apple's developer support website</a></p>
<p>Currently, Fastlane and Xcode do not handle this correctly for the CircleCI environment and in most cases attempting Enterprise iOS code signing will fail.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, please add the following steps to your job to download and install the new certificate into the system keychain:</p>
<pre>- run: curl https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer -o AppleWWDRCAG3.cer<br>- run: sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain AppleWWDRCAG3.cer</pre>
