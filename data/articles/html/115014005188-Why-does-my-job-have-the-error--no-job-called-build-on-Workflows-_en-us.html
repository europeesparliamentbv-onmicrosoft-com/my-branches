<p>You may run into this error for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>1. Your config file does not have a single job called <code>build</code></p>
<p>2. You are trying to run a workflow from the API, and no job called <code>build</code> exists in your config file. More on trigging a workflow with the API can be found <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/#trigger-a-new-build-by-project-preview">here</a>.</p>
