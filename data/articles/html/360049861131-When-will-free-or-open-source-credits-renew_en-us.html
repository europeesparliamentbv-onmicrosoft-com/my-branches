<h1>Open Source Credits</h1>
<p>Open Source projects receive 25,000 free credits for macOS builds and 400,000 free credits for Linux builds, renewing on the first of the month. Although Open Source credit availability will not be visible in the UI, these credits are only consumed by open source projects, and do not contribute towards your overall credit consumption. If you are blocked from building, please submit a ticket to Support or write to <a href="mailto:support@circleci.com">support@circleci.com</a> You can find more information on this here: <a href="https://circleci.com/open-source/">https://circleci.com/open-source/</a></p>
