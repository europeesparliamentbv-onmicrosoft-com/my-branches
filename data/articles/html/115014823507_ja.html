<p>Sometimes you may have trouble connecting to a networked resource in your container, such as database images connected as service containers. A simple way to discover the available connections within your container is to use nmap. Specifically the command <code>nmap -v -A localhost</code></p>
<p> When you run this command it will scan available ports to see which ones are open, and sometimes provide useful information about the service behind it. In the example below nmap has found an instance of MySQL running on port 3306 while also providing some information about the instance. It has also found a service running on port 5432 and correctly guessed that it's an instance of Postgres running. </p>
<p>It is not installed by default so you'll need to install it first before running it in your config</p>
