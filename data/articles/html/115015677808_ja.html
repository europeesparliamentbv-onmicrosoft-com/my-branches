<p>If you see this error displayed on your build page, it usually means that builds for this organization/user have been flagged as using resources in an inappropriate way (like running resource-intensive code that is unrelated to the purpose of a <abbr title="continuous integration/continuous delivery">CI/CD</abbr> service).</p>
<p>However, occasionally the 'abusive' flag can get set incorrectly. If you believe this has happened to your account, please <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">get in touch with support</a>.Â </p>
