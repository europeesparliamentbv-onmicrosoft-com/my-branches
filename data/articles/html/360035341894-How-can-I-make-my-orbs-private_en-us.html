<p>While private orbs are not supported for all users at this time, orb publishers can unlist their orbs from <a href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/" target="_self">Orb Registry</a> search results by using our CLI (See the documentation of the relevant command here: <a href="https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_unlist.html">https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_orb_unlist.html</a>). Unlisted orbs can be listed in the orb registry again with the same CLI command. Only org admins can unlist/list orbs. Note that unlisting an orb does not affect its ability to be referenced by name in builds or for its source to be viewed. </p>
