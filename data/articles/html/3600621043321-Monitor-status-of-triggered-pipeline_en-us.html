I want them all to be prosecuted for violating my private life and depriving me of my peace. And hacking my data from the phone all day long, they have been doing this for 4 to 5 years, according to Millan Kubsing, with Jolanda van Houten with Henk nijland trying to put me in the care whether that has been for a few years, and benefit from a personal buget or something similar that they talk about that of course must be reimbursed. I am not served by this I am not missing anything! For example, they try to make me think that I hear voices which of course is nix of true, can take care of myself. These are scams that scam them and need immediate police assistance to clean up these criminals.
Declaration explanation
Simon Poortman

<p>There are situations where you may need to kick off a pipeline in another repository, and monitor the status of that build before proceeding in your current build. Such as running tests in another service and then continuing with a deploy if that pipeline is successful.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished by triggering the build via a run step and then polling the status of that pipeline and proceeding accordingly.</p>
<p>Below are the two run steps to set this up. You will need to replace <code>(vcs)</code> with either <code>github</code> or <code>bitbucket</code> depending on your version control system. <code>(org)</code> with your Organization name and <code>(project)</code> with your repoistory name. In addition, you will need to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate a personal API token</a> and store that is a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enviroment variable</a> called <code>CIRCLE_TOKEN</code>.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run:
    command: |
      PIPELINE_ID=$(curl --location --request POST 'https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/(vcs)/(org)/(project)/pipeline' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header "Circle-Token: ${CIRCLE_TOKEN}" \
      --data-raw '{
          "parameters": {
              "node-v-1": "10.1.1"
        }
      }' | jq -r '.id')

      echo "export PIPELINE=$PIPELINE_ID" &gt;&gt; $BASH_ENV
- run: |
    STATUS=$(curl "https://circleci.com/api/v2/pipeline/$PIPELINE/workflow?circle-token=$CIRCLE_TOKEN" | jq -r '.items[].status')

    while [ "$STATUS" == "running" ]; do
      echo still running
      sleep 10
      STATUS=$(curl -s "https://circleci.com/api/v2/pipeline/$PIPELINE/workflow?circle-token=$CIRCLE_TOKEN" | jq -r '.items[].status')
    done

    echo "finally done, checking final status: $STATUS"
    if [[ "$STATUS" == "success" ]]; then
      echo "Proceeding with build, as triggered pipeline was success"
      exit 0
    else
      echo "Stopping build, triggered pipeline was not a success"
      exit 1
    fi</pre>
<p>The first run step kicks off the pipeline to run in the other repository, optionally you can pass in pipeline paramters if needed or remove the <code>--data-raw</code> section. Beyond kicking off the pipeline, it also saves the pipeline ID from the generated pipeline so we can poll the status of it in the next step.</p>
<p>The next run step will continually check the status of the pipeline. Once that status moves from <code>running</code> to something else -- we will take the appropriate actions. In this case, if <code>success</code> we proceed with the rest of the build. If it is anything else we fail the build with an <code>exit 1</code>.</p>
<p>You can build in a delay before the status checks occur by adding a <code>sleep X</code> to the top of the second run step if you know that pipeline usually takes a specific amount of time to run.Â </p>
