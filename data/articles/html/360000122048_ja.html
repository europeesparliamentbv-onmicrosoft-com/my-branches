<p>You're seeing the error:</p>
<p>&gt; failed to register layer: Error processing tar file(exit status 1): Container ID ... cannot be mapped to a host ID</p>
<p>Because that Docker image has one or more files owned by a Linux user with too high a UID/GID. You or the image maintainer will have to rebuild this image and ensure a user with a lower UID/GID owns those files. You can find more information [on this page in our docs](<a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/high-uid-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/high-uid-error/</a>)</p>
