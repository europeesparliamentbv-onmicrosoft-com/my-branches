<p>Here is a trick to give yourself a cache that is cleared daily. This is not required or recommended for many use cases but can prove potentially useful for some instances.</p>
<p>For instance, in building static blog sites that fetch from external API's, you may want to clear your cache periodically to ensure any new information is fetched.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong></p>
<p>Early in your job create a file containing today's date without a timestamp</p>
<pre><code>- run: date +%F &gt; date</code></pre>
<p>You can now use this file to test against when choosing when to rebuild cache by utilizing the checksum template.</p>
<pre><code>
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - date-cache-{{ checksum "date" }}
      - save_cache:
            key: date-cache-{{ checksum "date" }}
            paths:
                - "/docs"
</code></pre>
<p>Â The checksum of the <code>date</code> file will remain static until the next day, at which point a new cache will be created.</p>
